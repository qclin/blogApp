Write a blog app!

Your blog must contain posts. Posts must contain a title, a body, and the ability to have an image, but feel free to add more as you see fit.
Your blog must support all basic CRUD operations for posts (including forms for adding, editing, and removing posts). This might be a good time to experiment with the textarea type of input!
Your app must be written as an Express server and be backed by a Sqlite3 database.
You must make a new repo for this app.
You must add, commit, and push whenever you add a feature (although you should be doing it more frequently than that!).
You must write out a spec for your app and put it in your repo.
Your spec should include an ERD diagram.
